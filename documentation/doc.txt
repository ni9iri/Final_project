Document following :
a. Threshold resolution for responsiveness 
(max-width: 600px) - If the browser window is 600px or smaller, the background will act like mobile browser
b. Colors for the page. Use color wheel for planning. 
I have generated colors using this link - https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23845EC2&sub=1
#4B4453 – background color for navigation bar and the main section
#7C7484 – background color for footer
#00C0FF – for click button “Join Now”
#FF84DF – pink color for the word “ FUN “
#FFFFFF – the white color I have used for the rest of font letters + icon’s color

c. Typography: what fonts, font colors and main font sizes you will use.
I have chosen Montserrat as my font and the font-family is called Balsamiq Sans.
I used mainly color white as my font color and font size for the body is 1rem
d. Add images of the UI mockups in the document and link to Figma design.
